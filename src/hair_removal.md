Insurance coverage for electrolysis varies - for example Kaiser will cover 45 sessions for facial hair removal, a different number pre-surgery, etc. Insurance coverage for pre-surgery can vary, but electrolysis is usually required - OHSU, Kaiser, and Legacy will refer out to "community providers" which can be waitlisted. Trying to get non-approved providers on the approved list is possible.
